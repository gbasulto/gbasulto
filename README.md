I am a research scientist at the [Institute for Transportation at Iowa State University](https://www.intrans.iastate.edu/), with a strong background in statistics, data science, and transportation. My work focuses on developing statistical methodologies and computational tools to improve transportation research and support decision-making. I enjoy creating visualization tools (primarily using Shiny), developing statistical models related to transportation, and creating R packages.
